# Code-Quiz

## Description

An timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by a JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The important part of coding this application was to do it only with pure Javascript and no JS library.


The following gif demonstrates the application functionality:
